# ADAS-project-using-STM32f103c8t6
This is my graduation project based on AI & Embedded systems.
This is the STM32f103c8t6 HAL drivers, ECUAL drivers(Motor & Ultrasonic), and main.c code for doing the features of (Crash avoidance & Blind spot warning & Receiving data from the Raspberry Pi & changing the speed based on the speed of the another cars that is sent by the raspberry).

I have used timer3 & timer4 to handle the ultrasonic sensors, and I have used input capture direct mode with interrupts for this purpose.
I have used timer2 to handle the DC motors, and I have used PWM generation mode for this purpose.

The code is under update for adding another features and it will be updated continuously.
